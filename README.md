# String-manipulation
If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string. If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code. If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.
